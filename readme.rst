MonELOG 
=========================================

Description
The Base unit is the hub of an MonELOG monitoring solution. This new version works the 
same as the V.1.0 MonELOG, but also adds additional jacks to natively connect up to three 
AC Voltage Reference transformers to facilitate direct reference three-phase. Another 
significant improvement is the use of a new enclosure with integrated wall mount.
